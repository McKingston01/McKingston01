👋 Hi, I'm @McKingston01.
I'm a **full-stack developer**. I enjoy solving problems, I love turning ideas into digital solutions, with a focus on user experience and interactivity.

### 👀 What I'm interested in
I'm deeply interested in **web development**, specifically using **React** and **Vue.js** to create seamless front-end experiences. I'm also excited about the potential of **AI** and **chatbots**, and I'm working on projects that integrate AI into real-world applications, such as virtual assistants that can interact in a natural and engaging way.

### 🌱 What I'm currently learning
I'm currently delving into:
- Advanced techniques in **React** with **Tailwind CSS** for a sleek and modern UI/UX.
- Backend development with **Flask** and **Java** to power API-driven applications.
- Leveraging **Google Generative AI** for a personalized virtual assistant that adapts to user preferences, combining conversational AI with personality-based interactions.

### 💻 What I'm working on
- **Pulsea**: A virtual assistant project built with **Vue.js** that integrates **Hugging Face API** to manage real-time conversations. This assistant adapts to user emotions and preferences, adding a personal touch to every interaction.
- Developing a responsive user authentication and dashboard system with **Firebase** for authentication and user state management.
- Migrating legacy chat functionality from **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** to **React** for better modularity and maintainability.
